We met an acquaintance of Drake's known as Stoneheart inside of Baldur's Gate who asked for our assistance to hunt down members of the Shadow Thieves that he suspects are plotting to begin a war between Baldur's Gate and Amn. He has requested that we meed him in the sewer tunnels beneath the western district of the city and eliminate the Shadow Thief agents together.~

We assisted Stoneheart with eliminating a trio of Shadow Thief agents operating from beneath the city. Documents in their hideout, however, revealed that they had been framed by a third party as instigators of the rising tension between Baldur's Gate and Amn. Stoneheart has left to continue his mission, but I have been appropriately rewarded.~
